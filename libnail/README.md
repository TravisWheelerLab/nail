# libnail

## About

libnail is a library that performs profile Hidden Markov Model (PHMM) biological sequence alignment.

This libary is in early stages of development. The API should be considered highly unstable, and documentation is lacking.

## Installation

To build libnail from source, you'll first need to install Rust and Cargo. 
The easiest way to do that is to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Once that's done, you can then build nail:

    git clone https://github.com/TravisWheelerLab/nail
    cd nail/
    cargo build --release
